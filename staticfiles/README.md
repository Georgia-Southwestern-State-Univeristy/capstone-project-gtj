## About
<p>GTJ Go is a travel guide made by women for women and solo travelers who value safety, convenience, and accessibility. GTJ Go is the convenient companion that offers live language translation, currency exchange figures, and safety ratings. GTJ Go calculates safety ratings using the most current data about domestic violence, women's/solo walking safety, domestic violence laws, female homicide rates, crime rates, political freedom, and gives a percentage using a modern AI-generated formula. This ranking is then used to give advice and guidelines about your specific destination. 
GTJ Go also values safe transportation by recommending the safest and most affordable public transportation routes, including buses and subway systems, eliminating the confusion of getting around a new city.   </p>
